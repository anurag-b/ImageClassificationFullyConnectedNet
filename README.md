# ImageClassificationFullyConnectedNet
This repo is a tutorial on implementation of image classification using fully connected network using Keras with tensorflow backend.

In this repo, you can see how to implement a Fully Connected Neural Network in Keras. We will use handwritten digit classification as an example to illustrate the effectiveness of a feedforward network. We will also see how to spot and overcome Overfitting during training.

MNIST is a commonly used handwritten digit dataset consisting of 60,000 images in the training set and 10,000 images in the test set. So, each digit has 6000 images in the training set. The digits are size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size ( 28Ã—28 ) image. The task is to train a machine learning algorithm to recognize a new sample from the test set correctly.
